## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- AWS account with an S3 bucket created 

### Run with Docker

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the project directory
cd question-service

# 2. Build and start everything
docker compose up --build

# 3. The service is ready when you see:
#    Database connected successfully.
#    Question Service running on port 3000
```

The database is seeded automatically with 20 sample questions on first run.

> **Note:** The seed only runs on the very first `docker compose up` when the volume is brand new. It will not re-run or duplicate data on subsequent starts.

### Resetting the Database

If you need to wipe all data and re-seed from scratch:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
```

The `-v` flag deletes the named volume, forcing Postgres to reinitialise.

### Run Locally (without Docker)

```bash
# 1. Start Postgres via Docker only
docker compose up postgres -d

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Copy and configure the env file
cp .env.example .env
# Change DB_HOST=postgres to DB_HOST=localhost

# 4. Start the service
npm run dev   # hot-reload via nodemon
# or
npm start
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `3001` | Port the service listens on |
| `DB_HOST` | `postgres` | PostgreSQL host (`localhost` when running outside Docker) |
| `DB_PORT` | `5432` | PostgreSQL port |
| `DB_NAME` | `peerprep_questions` | Database name |
| `DB_USER` | `postgres` | Database user |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | `postgres` | Database password |
| `USER_SERVICE_URL` | URL of the User Service for admin verification |
| `AWS_REGION` | AWS region of your S3 bucket (e.g. `ap-southeast-1`) |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS IAM access key |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS IAM secret key |
| `S3_BUCKET_NAME` | Name of your S3 bucket |

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE questions (
    question_id   SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title         VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description   TEXT NOT NULL,
    constraints   TEXT,
    test_cases    JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',
    leetcode_link VARCHAR(500),
    difficulty    VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL CHECK (difficulty IN ('Easy', 'Medium', 'Hard')),
    topics        TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    image_urls    TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at    TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at    TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

- `test_cases` is stored as **JSONB** so Postgres understands the structure, validates it, and allows future querying inside the field.
- `image_urls` stores only URLs. Actual images are hosted on a third-party service.
- `updated_at` is automatically updated via a Postgres trigger on every row update.

### Test Case Format

For standard algorithm questions:
```json
[
  { 
    "input": "s = [\"h\",\"e\",\"l\",\"l\",\"o\"]",
    "output": "[\"o\",\"l\",\"l\",\"e\",\"h\"]" 
  }
]
```

For database questions with multiple input tables:
```json
[
  {
    "input": {
      "Person": [
        { "personId": 1, "lastName": "Wang", "firstName": "Allen" }
      ],
      "Address": [
        { "addressId": 1, "personId": 2, "city": "New York City", "state": "New York" }
      ]
    },
    "output": [
      { "firstName": "Allen", "lastName": "Wang", "city": null, "state": null }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Health Check

| Method | Path | Auth |
|--------|------|------|
| GET | `/health` | None |

**Response 200**
```json

```json
{
  "error": "Validation Error",
  "message": "The following required fields are missing or invalid.",
  "missingFields": ["title", "difficulty"]
}
```

---

### Update Question *(Admin only)*

| Method | Path | Auth |
|--------|------|------|
| PUT | `/questions/:id` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |

**Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`

Send only the fields you want to update. All fields are optional — unset fields keep their existing values.

| `images` | file(s) | New image files to upload and append |

**Image update behaviour:**
 
| Scenario | What to send |
|----------|-------------|
| Keep all existing images, add new ones | Send new `images` files only |
| Remove some existing images, keep others | Send `existingImageUrls` with only the URLs to keep |
| Remove all existing images | Send `existingImageUrls: []` |
| No image changes | Omit both `existingImageUrls` and `images` |

**Response 200** — updated question object.

---

### Delete Question *(Admin only)*

| Method | Path | Auth |
|--------|------|------|
| DELETE | `/questions/:id` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |

Deletes the question from the database **and** removes all associated images from S3.

**Response 200**
```json
{ "message": "Question \"Reverse a String\" (ID: 1) deleted successfully." }
```

---

## Admin Authentication

Admin-only routes (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The middleware calls the **User Service** at `GET /users/me` to verify the token and check that the user's role is `admin`. The User Service must return:

```json
{ "id": "123", "role": "admin" }
```

**While the User Service is not yet running**, admin routes will return:
```json
{
  "error": "Service Unavailable",
  "message": "User Service is not reachable..."
}
```

To test admin routes locally before the User Service is ready, temporarily remove `requireAdmin` from the routes in `src/routes/questions.js`:

```javascript
// Temporarily remove requireAdmin for local testing
router.post('/', createQuestion);
router.put('/:id', updateQuestion);
router.delete('/:id', deleteQuestion);
```

Remember to add it back before integrating with other services.

## Testing the API

Use **Postman**, **Thunder Client** (VS Code extension), or `curl`.

Make sure Docker is running first:
```bash
docker compose up
```

curl "http://localhost:3001/questions?topics=Strings,Algorithms"

# Filter by topic and difficulty
curl "http://localhost:3001/questions?topics=Algorithms&difficulty=Medium"

# Get question by ID
curl http://localhost:3001/questions/1

# Create a question with no image
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/questions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer " \
  -F "title=Two Sum" \
  -F "description=Given an array of integers..." \
  -F "difficulty=Easy" \

## Notes

- Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` - never commit it to version control.
- Images are stored externally; only the URL is stored in the database.
